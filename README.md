# MapboxSharp

An easy to use wrapper library for the Mapbox API. Simply add a reference to the MapboxSharp `.dll` to your project and you're good to go!

Previous Mapbox C# wrappers have become dorment, hence the birth of MapboxSharp. As new functionality arrives in the API, this library will be updated to support it.

For full documentation on the `v5` API, please refer to: https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation

*This project is currently in the early phases of development and subject to change. Before integrating it into an existing product, please be aware that future commits may break functionality.*

# Contributing

Thanks for being interested! If you're looking for a quick in to the project, check out some of the outstanding [issues](https://github.com/james-gould/MapboxSharp/issues). This should help you get acquanited with the project and code fairly quickly.

The project follows a string styling guide, which hasn't been written up yet. If you're wanting send a pull request, don't worry about stylistic differences. If anything needs updating prior to the writeup of the styleguide, I'll fix up the pull request so it's stylistically consistent with the rest of the code.
