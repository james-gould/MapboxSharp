# MapboxSharp

An easy to use wrapper library for the Mapbox API. Simply Add a reference to the MapboxSharp `.dll` to your project and you're good to go!

Previous Mapbox C# wrappers have become dorment, hence the birth of MapboxSharp. As new functionality arrives in the API, this library will be updated to support it.

# Planned functionality

It's early days yet, but here's what's planned:

- Full support of `Mapbox Directions`, `Map Matching` and `Geocoding`.
