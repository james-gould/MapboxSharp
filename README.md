# MapboxSharp

An easy to use wrapper library for the Mapbox API. Simply Add a reference to the MapboxSharp `.dll` to your project and you're good to go!

Previous Mapbox C# wrappers have become dorment, hence the birth of MapboxSharp. As new functionality arrives in the API, this library will be updated to support it.

For full documentation on the `v5` API, please refer to: https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation
